# API_mini_project
This was completed as a part of the Springboard Data Science Career Track course (Unit18.2.5 API Mini-Project).

This exercise involved the stock price data of Carl Zeiss Meditec, which manufactures tools for eye examinations, and medical lasers for laser eye surgery, from Nasdaq (formerly Qunadl API). I pulled data from API and performed data wrangling to a JSON file.
